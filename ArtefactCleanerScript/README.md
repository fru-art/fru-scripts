# Artefact Cleaner

![img.png](img.png)

This script will clean and use [lamps]([Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart)) for slow XP. You can use it to train skills like defense, slayer, and prayer on pures. You can also use it to train for minigame access, such as farming for Tithe Farm.

If you like the script, consider donating to me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart) ☕. I'll be looking into updates and other scripts in the future.

See below for release notes!

## FAQ
> Why not spam-click to get rocks faster?

After significant testing, I've decided to remove spam-clicks from most of my scripts due to increased risks of bans.

> Can you add XYZ skill?

You can DM me to ask. I would appreciate a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart) :)
