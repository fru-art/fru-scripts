## FAQ
> Is this good for money making?

I've found that you can make a bit of money with cheaper herbs that have high margins, but expensive herbs may not be profitable due to GE taxes.
See the [wiki calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Herblore/Herbs) and remember to account for GE taxes.

> Why no fast-clean?

After significant testing, I've decided to remove spam-clicks from most of my scripts due to increased risks of bans.
