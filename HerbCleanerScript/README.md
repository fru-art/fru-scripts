Bank-stands and fast-cleans all your dirty herbs with a bit of humanization.

If you like the script, consider donating to me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart) â˜•. I'll be looking into updates and other scripts in the future.

See below for release notes!

## FAQ
> What are XP rates?

You can expect to clean an upwards of 50,000 herbs in a reasonably human day. XP rates depend on the type of herb used.

> Is this good for money making?

I've found that you can make a bit of money with cheaper herbs that have high margins, but expensive herbs may not be profitable due to GE taxes.

See the [wiki calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Herblore/Herbs) and remember to account for GE taxes.
