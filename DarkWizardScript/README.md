# Dark Wizards

![img.png](img.png)

Kill Dark Wizards and loot their runes! This script will also run to the west Varrock bank to withdraw food.

If you like the script, consider donating to me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart) â˜•. I'll be looking into updates and other scripts in the future.

See below for release notes!
