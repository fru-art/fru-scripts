## Known issues
- Does not currently support runite ore
- Does not currently support dropping ores

## FAQ
> Why does this cost $50?

A couple reasons:
- Because there is demand for a Mining training method that is safer than Motherlode Mine
- Because providing a popular free public version would crowd the available ore rocks

> What are XP rates?

- Mining iron ore: up to 50k Mining XP per hour
- Smithing gold bars at Blast Furnace with gauntlets: up to 300k Smithing XP per hour
- Crafting gold and silver jewelry: up to 50k Crafting XP per hour

> Can I use this to farm gold?

Mining iron is probably the most profitable, coming in at around 200-300k GP per hour. I don't plan on adding runite anytime soon because those rocks are always crowded by other bots.
