# Power Miner

![img.png](img.png)

This script mines and drops ores (and gems) up to iron. It will also attempt to move to avoid crowded rocks and world hop to avoid crowded areas.

Supported areas include:
- Isle of Souls mine
- Legends' Guild mine
- Rimmington mine
- Most of the Mining Guild
- Al Kharid mine
- Southeast Varrock mine

If you like the script, consider donating to me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fruart) â˜•. I'll be looking into updates and other scripts in the future.

See below for release notes!

## Start
- Download and install the JAR from [here](https://github.com/fru-art/fru-scripts/blob/master/out/artifacts/PowerMinerScript.jar). See [Community Script Guidelines](https://discord.com/channels/736938454478356570/1364978724105355324)
- Go to your preferred location and make sure you have a pickaxe and some inventory free
- Start the script
    - Highly recommended to have a world hopping profile since the script will use it to avoid crowded worlds. See [Profile Management Guidelines](https://discord.com/channels/736938454478356570/1393939764092207134/1393939764092207134)
